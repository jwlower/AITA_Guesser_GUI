# AITA_Guesser_GUI
Data Mining project on the r/AITA subreddit. A simple GUI lets users predetermine the outcome of their posts with the power of machine learning.  

## TKinter GUI
This program has a simple GUI that can be run through the GUI.py file. Users input text into the text field then click one of the buttons to select an algorithm to make a prediction on their text.

## Algorithms
Each algorithm, Naive Bayes, Multi-layer perceptron, K-Nearest neighbors, and Random Forest have been pre-trainned. The data used was scraped from this subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/
Users can make up their own bodytext or copy in the bodytext from a post on this subreddit to get a prediction on the outcome. 
Each outcome comes from the flairs used in this subreddit; "Not the A-hole", "You're the A-hole","Everyone Sucks","No A-holes here".
